# Pyc2BC (Updated)

A Python Bytecode Disassembler for helping reverse engineers in dissecting Python binaries by disassembling and analyzing the compiled python byte-code (.pyc) files across all python versions

## Usage: 

To run Pyc2BC:
```
> Console Disassembled Output: python pyc2bc.py -p <pyc_file_path>
> Save Disassembled Output to a file: python pyc2bc.py -p <pyc_file_path> -o <output_file_path> 
```
## Demonstration:

**Pyc2BC** can be used by researchers for reverse engineering Malicious Python Binaries and tear them apart in order to understand the inner workings of the binary statically.

## Future Development:

- Develop a Python decompiler for recent python versions
